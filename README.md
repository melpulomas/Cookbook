# Cookbook
Cookbook is a fusion between social media and traditional cookbooks and aims to revolutionalise how we share our recipes online. Users may create their own recipes and cookbooks and publish it for their followers to view, like and comment. This project is inspired by my mother who loves to share her own recipe creation online through Instagram and Whatsapp, but wished that there was a way to group recipes together easily and let her peers to view and comment just like in other social medias. So from aspiring chefs to michelin star masterchefs, you can be the next big cooking influencer by sharing your recipes and cookbook here!
